    <p>After looking at the WAVE accessibility tool the contrast is one that stands out because how the site is visually seen is going to effect the was users interact with it. 
      There will be elements that some just can't see with low contrast . The other thing I would change is something that probably doesn't have much impact on most people but adjusting the layout would help make tables on the site more logical, meaning making sure the table element contained header cells.
      <!--using header <th> cells within the <table> element-->
